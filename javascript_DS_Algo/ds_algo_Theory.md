> #### **Main Methods related to Stack**
    
        push() // add new element at the top of stack
        pop()  // remove top element of stack
        peek() // displays top element of stack
        length() // to determine total element in the stack

> **NOTE - Now by default javascript array has already all the built in methods to use as stack**

> ## Sets (DS) refer sets_js_oops.js

- Similar to array with the condition that their are no duplicate items.
- the items are not in any particular order.
- **The use case of sets is to check the presence of an item.**

- **In ES6 syntax set is already implemented but not with all functionality so it is better to implement set on your own completely.**

#### **Functionality that are present in built in set in javascript ES6 are->**

                
                has() // to check the membership
                add() //method
                delete() //method
                size // prop

### Self Implemented Set (the ES6 methods+prop and additions like below)

            union()
            intersection()
            difference()
            subset()
